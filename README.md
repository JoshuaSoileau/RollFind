# Rollfind

Quick search of ⚔️ D&amp;D rules, stats, details, and general info.

## What?

I've been wanting a tool that's just a single input field, that I can use to quickly look up things during DnD sessions.

## Why?

Because I got tired of looking up how many dice to roll for a Potion of Greater Healing.

## How?

This tool is really just a fancy wrapper around [Open5e.com](https://www.open5e.com)'s api.

It's all open source!

Click on the octocat on the top right hand corner to see all the
source code.

### But here's the TLDR, it's built with:

- Open5e
- React & create-react-app
- Tailwind CSS
- Twin.Macro
- and is hosted on Netlify
